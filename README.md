# NN For ASL to English

This is an application built using [Digital Ocean's](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-neural-network-to-translate-sign-language-into-english) tutorial as a reference.

The aim is to create a python application making use of PyTorch, OpenCV and onnx, to translate American Sign Language to English.

This will (hopefully) give me the experience needed in order to build my own converter to convert Barbadian Sign Language into English.
